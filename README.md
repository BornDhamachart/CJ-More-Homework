### Step 1: Create a Vite React Typescript Project

Open your terminal and run the following commands:

```shell
yarn create vite my-project --template react-ts
cd my-project
```

This will create a new Vite project with React and TypeScript template and navigate you to the project directory.

### Step 2: Add Tailwind CSS

Now, you need to add Tailwind CSS and related dependencies:

```shell
yarn add -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer
```

### Step 3: Initialize Tailwind CSS

Initialize Tailwind CSS by running:

```shell
yarn tailwindcss init -p
```

This will generate a `tailwind.config.cjs` file in your project directory.

### Step 4: Configure Tailwind CSS

Edit the `tailwind.config.cjs` file to include the content paths:

```javascript
// tailwind.config.cjs
module.exports = {
  content: [
    "./index.html",
    "./src/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}",
  ],
  theme: {
    extend: {},
  },
  plugins: [],
}
```

This configuration tells Tailwind CSS where to look for styles.

### Step 5: Create CSS File

In your project directory, create an `index.css` file and include Tailwind CSS directives:

```css
/* index.css */
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;
```

### Step 6: Start the Development Server

Run the development server:

```shell
yarn dev
```

This will start your project with Vite's development server.

### Step 7: Set Up GitHub Repository

Go to GitHub and create a new repository for your project.

### Step 8: Initialize Git and Push to GitHub

In your terminal, initialize Git, add your files, commit your changes, and push them to your GitHub repository:

```shell
git init
git branch -M main
git remote add origin <your-github-repo-url>
git add .
git commit -m "first commit"
git push -u origin main
```

Replace `<your-github-repo-url>` with the actual URL of your GitHub repository.

Now, your project is set up with Vite, React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and is hosted on GitHub. You can continue developing your project and push changes to your GitHub repository as needed.
