# CJ Homework Website

Welcome to the CJ Homework Website! This platform is dedicated to showcasing my assignment from CJ. The assignment entails creating a website capable of uploading pictures of shelves in convenient shops and providing the functionality to approve or reject these images directly on the platform.

The website is designed with responsiveness in mind to ensure compatibility across various devices.
